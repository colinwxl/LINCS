      <p>
        The purpose of this workshop is to bring together (Library of Integrated
        Network-based Cellular Signatures) LINCS scientists and scientists from
        the alcohol research community to explore how LINCS resources can facilitate
        identification of druggable targets and novel and/or repurposed compounds
        for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

        <strong>Hands-on Session: Web Apps and Tools</strong>
        <br />
        Session Leaders: Avi Maâ€™ayan
        PhD, <a href="http://lincs-dcic.org/#/" target="_blank">BD2K-LINCS Data
        Coordination and Integration Center</a> and Aravind Subramanian

        for Transcriptomics</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This session will consist of a hands-on demonstration of currently
        available web apps and tools from the LINCS Common Fund program.
        Participants will learn how to apply these tools to their own research
        programs. Please bring your laptop computer and gene expression or other
        genomic data to analyze.
      </p>
      <h5>Additional Information</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Please register and create
          a lincscloud.org account
          before the workshop.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your genomics datasets you bring to analyze should be formatted either as
          (1) official gene symbols or (2) Affymetrix U133A probe IDs. Some of the web
          tools require a list of both up-regulated and down-regulated gene lists and
          some of the tools only accept gene symbols.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because the majority of the LINCS datasets use human cell lines, gene sets
          should be annotated for mammalian species.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you RSVP for the workshop, please indicate your area of expertise:
          genomics, computational or other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also, if you already have experience with working with any of the LINCS
          tools, you are welcome to submit questions/concerns, suggestions or other
          feedback in advance of the workshop. You can submit your questions etc.,
          to the workshop organizer: Matthew Reilly at reillymt@mail.nih.gov.
