    "description": "The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center is part of the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) NIH initiative, and it is the data coordination center for the NIH Common Fund's Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program, which aims to characterize how a variety of human cells, tissues and the entire organism respond to perturbations by drugs and other molecular factors. This Center is co-funded by BD2K and the NIH Common Fund (NI­H grant number: U54HL127624)."

    "description": "The Harvard Medical School (HMS) LINCS Center is part of the NIH Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures Program. The goal of this program is to collect and disseminate the data and analytical tools needed to understand how human cells respond to perturbations created by exposure to drugs, changes in the environment and mutation (“perturbagens”). LINCS is supported by the NIH Common Fund and the HMS program is funded by NIH grant U54 HL127365."

    "description": "The overarching goal of the Broad Institute’s LINCS program is the development of comprehensive signatures of cellular states that can be used by the entire research community to understand protein function, small-molecule action, physiological states and disease states. Our center will create the world’s most comprehensive resource of perturbational signatures. This will include 1.4 million L1000 genetic (CRISPER knock-out, shRNA knock-down and ORF over-expression) and small-molecule (drug and tool compound) perturbations spanning 50 cell types of varied lineage. We will make it possible for biologists and computational scientists worldwide to interact with the data by creating user-friendly apps that are designed to facilitate biological discovery."

    "description": "The LINCS Proteomic Characterization Center for Signaling and Epigenetics, under the direction of Dr. Jacob D. Jaffe of the Broad Institute, tests the hypothesis that early modulation of signaling events in response to perturbations can establish new cellular states by altering their epigenetic landscapes. Using cutting-edge mass spectrometry-based proteomics assays, the center broadly profiles cellular responses in the spaces of phosphosignaling and histone modifications (epigenetic “marks”) in a highly multiplexed manner. The center focuses on perturbing genes and pathways in foundational biology systems (such as cancer cell lines) and in neurobiological cellular differentiation paradigms (under direction of co-investigator Dr. Li-Huei Tsai of MIT). Next-generation proteomic data acquisition and analysis strategies to support these activities are being developed in the laboratory of Dr. Michael MacCoss of the University of Washington."

    "description": "The Drug Toxicity Signature Generation Center is a NIH-funded Systems Pharmacology research center at the Icahn School of Medicine. The proteomics experiments for the center are conducted at the Center for Advanced Proteomics, Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School. DToxS is part of the LINCS consortium of centers. LINCS (Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures) is a program supported by the NIH Common Fund. The goals of the LINCS consortium as stated on the LINCS website at the NIH include the “large-scale production of perturbation-induced molecular and cellular signatures” and the development of the informatics and analytical tools that enable utilization by all of the research community."

    "description": "The NeuroLINCS Center is an NIH-funded collaborative effort between various research groups with expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, OMICS methods, and computational biology. The participating research groups are from the University of California- Irvine, Cedars Sinai, the Gladstone Institute, MIT, and Johns Hopkins University. Together, the NeuroLINCS data and signature generation center studies human brain cells to understand the causes of neurological disease and to develop new therapies. NeuroLINCS is part of the LINCS (Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures) consortium of centers, which is supported by the NIH Common Fund."
