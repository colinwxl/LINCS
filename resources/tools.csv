The pathways derived in this way predict interlinking genes that may correspond to essential components of cancer signaling and may provide a mechanistic explanation of tumor behavior and suggest subtype-specific drug targets. In addition, the algorithm can extend to generate connecting subnetworks for generic gene sets, and runs a null-model permutation test to determine if these sets are significantly close in pathway space.",https://sysbiowiki.soe.ucsc.edu/tiedie,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,
