,PAEA - Principal Angle Enrichment Analysis,"Functional analysis of genome-wide differential expression is central to biological investigations. Here we present a new multivariate approach to gene-set enrichment called Principal Angle Enrichment Analysis (PAEA). PAEA uses the geometrical concept of the principal angle to quantify gene-set enrichment. We find that PAEA outperforms a selection of commonly used gene set enrichment methods including GSEA. To benchmark PAEA with other enrichment methods we use real data. We examined the ranking of transcription factors by performing enrichment analysis on gene expression signatures from many studies that knocked-down, knocked-out or over-expressed transcription factors, and performed the enrichment analysis with a library of gene sets created from ChIP-Seq data profiling the same transcription factors. We also found that PAEA was able to rank better aging-related phenotype-terms from a collection of gene expression profiling studies where tissue from young adults was compared to tissue of elderly subjects. PAEA is implemented as a user-friendly R Shiny gene-set enrichment web application with over 70 gene set libraries available for enrichment analysis. Canned enrichment analysis for over 700 disease signatures extracted from GEO is provided with the application which is freely available at: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/PAEA .",http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/PAEA,http://lincs-dcic.org/libs/lincs-direct-access-tools/tool-icons/paea.png,,16,1,,1,1,,1,1,1,1,1,,1,,,,
,iLINCS,"iLINCS (Integrative LINCS) is an integrative web platform for analysis of LINCS data and signatures.

The portal integrates R analytical engine via several R tools for web-computing (rserve, opencpu, Shiny, rgl) and DCIC developed web tools and applications (FTreeView, Enrichr) into a coherent web platform for LINCS data analysis. Users can follow several workflows which allow them to identify differentially expressed genes, proteins and phosphoproteins in LINCS datasets and use them in analysis of other LINCS and non-LINCS dataset (eg TCGA and GEO transcriptomic datasets), and in the analysis of LINCS L1000 signatures. In this way, the platform facilitates integrative analysis of LINCS data and signatures.",http://eh3.uc.edu/GenomicsPortals/Lincs.jsp,http://lincs-dcic.org/libs/lincs-direct-access-tools/tool-icons/i-lincs2.png,3,2,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,,,

,Harmonizome,"Thanks to technological advances in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and related fields, projects that generate a large number of measurements of the properties of cells, tissues, model organisms, and patients are becoming commonplace in biomedical research. In addition, curation projects are making great progress mining biomedical literature to extract and aggregate decades worth of research findings into online databases. Such projects are generating a wealth of information that potentially can guide research toward novel biomedical discoveries and advances in healthcare. To facilitate access to and learning from biomedical Big Data, we created the Harmonizome: a collection of information about genes and proteins from 114 datasets provided by 66 online resources.",http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome/,http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome/image/logo_100x87.png,,12,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,,,

,TieDIE,"The TieDIE algorithm computes a subnetwork of gene and protein interactions that connect genomic perturbations to gene expression changes characteristic of cancer subtypes. The pathways derived in this way predict interlinking genes that may correspond to essential components of cancer signaling and may provide a mechanistic explanation of tumor behavior and suggest subtype-specific drug targets. In addition, the algorithm can extend to generate connecting subnetworks for generic gene sets, and runs a null-model permutation test to determine if these sets are significantly close in pathway space.",https://sysbiowiki.soe.ucsc.edu/tiedie,http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/explore-tiedie.jpg,,17,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,
