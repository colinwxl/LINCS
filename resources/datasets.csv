These peptides are mixed with a set of isotopically-labeled internal standards that correspond to the analytes in the P100 assay. This mixture is introduced into a mass spectrometer using ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (LCMS) and subjected to an analysis method specific for quantification of the P100 analytes. The behavior of more than 1000 unique phosphosites may be imputed from the profiles of the P100 analytes.
